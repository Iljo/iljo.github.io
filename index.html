<p>Welcome, this is main page for my two cents. Below are some articles about development stuff, I hope you'll find something usefull.</p> 

<p>Currently here's just one article, if you see more of them, that means I forgot to update this introduction. ;)</p>
<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> » <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
